![Maze Patronus](patronus_maze.png)

A simple and fun maze solver game inspired by Harry Potter’s Patronus. The program finds the shortest path through mazes that may have multiple solutions, with visual step-by-step solving animation.

## Features

- Loads maze layouts from text files.
- Finds the shortest path among multiple solutions with backtracking.
- Visualizes the solving process using a simple graphical canvas.
- Choose between different solving strategies.
- Interactive command line interface to select maze and pause speed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed

### How to Run

1. Compile the Java source files: javac MazeChallenge.java RunTournament.java SimpleCanvas.java
2. Run the tournament driver: java RunTournamen
3. 3. Enter the maze filename (e.g., `maze5.txt`), pause time in milliseconds, and solver type (`boolean` or `directional`).

## How to Play

- Load your maze file.
- Watch the solver try to find the shortest path to the "cup" (goal).
- The position of "Harry" (start) and "Cup" are marked in the maze.
- Paths are shown on screen as the solver moves.

## Example Maze Files

Several example maze layouts are included in text files like `maze5.txt`, `maze6-challenge.txt`.
