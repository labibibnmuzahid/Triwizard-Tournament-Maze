# Triwizard-Tournament-Maze
This project is a fun maze solver that finds the shortest path in tricky mazes with multiple solutions. You can load different maze files, watch the solving process visually, and even pick different solving strategies. It’s a neat little Java program perfect for anyone interested in algorithms and game-like challenges.
